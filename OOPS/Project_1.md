Sure, let's break down a Library Management System project in detail. Here are the main components and features you should include:

### Classes

2. **Member**:
   - Attributes:
     - `name`: The name of the member.
     - `member_id`: A unique identifier for the member.
     - `borrowed_books`: A list of books borrowed by the member.
   - Methods:
     - `__init__(self, name, member_id)`: Initialize the member's attributes.
     - `__str__(self)`: Return a string representation of the member.
     - `borrow_book(self, book)`: Add a book to the member's borrowed books list.
     - `return_book(self, book)`: Remove a book from the member's borrowed books list.

3. **Library**:
   - Attributes:
     - `books`: A dictionary of books in the library with ISBN as the key.
     - `members`: A dictionary of members in the library with member ID as the key.
   - Methods:
     - `__init__(self)`: Initialize the library's attributes.
     - `add_book(self, book)`: Add a book to the library's collection.
     - `remove_book(self, isbn)`: Remove a book from the library's collection.
     - `find_book(self, isbn)`: Find a book by its ISBN.
     - `add_member(self, member)`: Add a member to the library.
     - `remove_member(self, member_id)`: Remove a member from the library.
     - `borrow_book(self, member_id, isbn)`: Allow a member to borrow a book.
     - `return_book(self, member_id, isbn)`: Allow a member to return a book.
     - `display_books(self)`: Display all books in the library.
     - `display_members(self)`: Display all members in the library.

### Features and Their Implementation

1. **Add Books**:
   - Create a `Book` object and add it to the `Library`'s `books` dictionary.

2. **Remove Books**:
   - Remove a `Book` object from the `Library`'s `books` dictionary using its ISBN.

3. **Find Books**:
   - Search for a book in the `Library`'s `books` dictionary using its ISBN.

4. **Add Members**:
   - Create a `Member` object and add it to the `Library`'s `members` dictionary.

5. **Remove Members**:
   - Remove a `Member` object from the `Library`'s `members` dictionary using the member ID.

6. **Borrow Books**:
   - Check if the book is available in the library.
   - Check if the member has already borrowed the maximum allowed number of books.
   - Update the `borrowed_books` list of the `Member` and decrease the number of copies of the `Book`.

7. **Return Books**:
   - Check if the member has borrowed the book.
   - Update the `borrowed_books` list of the `Member` and increase the number of copies of the `Book`.

8. **Display All Books**:
   - Iterate through the `Library`'s `books` dictionary and print the details of each book.

9. **Display All Members**:
   - Iterate through the `Library`'s `members` dictionary and print the details of each member.

### Additional Features to Consider

1. **Search Books by Title or Author**:
   - Implement a search feature to find books by title or author.

2. **Limit the Number of Books a Member Can Borrow**:
   - Add a condition to limit the number of books a member can borrow.

3. **Handle Overdue Books**:
   - Track the due dates for borrowed books and implement a feature to handle overdue books.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Create a simple command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter.

By building this Library Management System, you'll get hands-on experience with OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, as well as practice working with collections like dictionaries and lists.

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn, copies):
        self.title = title

    def borrow_book(self, member_id, isbn):
        member = self.members.get(member_id)
        book = self.books.get(isbn)
        if member and book:
            return member.borrow_book(book)
        return False

    def return_book(self, member_id, isbn):
        member = self.members.get(member_id)
        book = self.books.get(isbn)
        if member and book:
            return member.return_book(book)
        return False

    def display_books(self):
        for book in self.books.values():
            print(book)

    def display_members(self):
        for member in self.members.values():
            print(member)

# Example Usage
library = Library()

# Adding books
book1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell", "1234567890", 5)
book2 = Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", "1234567891", 3)
library.add_book(book1)
library.add_book(book2)

# Adding members
member1 = Member("Alice", "M001")
member2 = Member("Bob", "M002")
library.add_member(member1)
library.add_member(member2)

# Borrowing books
library.borrow_book("M001", "1234567890")
library.borrow_book("M002", "1234567891")

# Displaying books and members
library.display_books()
library.display_members()

# Returning books
library.return_book("M001", "1234567890")
library.return_book("M002", "1234567891")

# Displaying books and members again
library.display_books()
library.display_members()
